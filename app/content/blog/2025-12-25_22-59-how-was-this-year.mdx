- moved to barcelona (finally)
- went to concerts and festivals
- flew more than 11 times (fewer than last year)
- trip to galicia (i want to live there)
- first time being rescued (got lost in the mountains)
- new challenges
- learned a lot of hands-on things

---

## jan

short version:

- 3 trips
- solved an old conflict
- hard gz x anniversary concerts
- minor guilt over old conflicts

this month my main objective was to replicate last year.  
in 2024 i went to hard gz in malaga.  
this time i needed madrid and bcn for the x anniversary.  
i was really excited.

i also brought some issues from the previous year.  
breakdowns.  
i wanted to solve what i had provoked with a friend.

i needed to fly for work for 2-3 days.  
wanted to see the simplr team and cat.  
i met her while looking for someone to go to rocanrola.  
she was friendly and liked the same type of music.  
but in the end, i didn’t see anyone.

near the end of the month, the conflict was solved.  
before the bcn trip.  
i felt a little relief.  
guilt lingered for a couple of weeks.

regarding the x anniversary in madrid:  
it was awesome.  
i really enjoyed the concert.  
alone.  
i sang all the songs, shouted.  
lost my voice that day, haha.

the second concert in bcn was almost the same.  
i went with cat.  
some songs were missing, some collabs gone.  
still enjoyable.  
we sang a lot.  
memories i really treasure.

## feb

short version:

- donated blood
- itv (car inspection)
- san valentin (painful)
- cat trip
- first psycho session

this month still gives me nightmares.

i went to donate blood.  
needed to do something meaningful.  
went alone.

cat shared her trip photos.  
warm, unexpected.  
nice moment.

itv.  
we were late.  
the car didn’t pass.  
needed a mechanic.  
almost caused a conflict via whatsapp.  
my replies were dry.  
funny in retrospect.

psycho session went well.  
told me i was improving compared to 2023.  
i talked about conflicts, gifts, feelings.  
she encouraged me to act and feel.

san valentin.  
first time doing such a thing.  
awkward.  
i gave someone a gift.  
she said **_“no, no, no”_** at first (kill me).  
felt dumped.  
the gift was received, it wasn't the worst.  
main event of the month.

---

## mar

short version:

- jsconf
- salary increase
- rural trip
- serious talks
- kuromi girl incident

everything seemed fine.

first jsconf with midudev.  
loved the talks, met wonderful people.

work meeting:  
salary increase approved.  
month started well.

rural trip with friends.  
wanted to relax, chill with music, sleep.  
i'm not big on socializing.

house near a river.  
first day dry, next days heavy rain.  
river got full, hard to exit walking, even with cars.  
enjoyable experience.

later: serious talks with a friend.  
we tried to set things straight.

**kuromi girl incident:**  
i disconnected from everything for two weeks.  
mom's birthday, dad's birthday.  
retaking contact, i expressed myself too intensely.  
she told me to calm down.  
first time i had to hide my feelings.  
after san valentin, emotions were harder to process.

---

## apr

short version:

- second blood donation
- attempts to disconnect
- baking and gifts
- tangerine series
- low mood from distance

april started with an attempt to calm down.  
i went to donate blood for the second time.  
i wanted to do something meaningful, something that actually helped.

started baking.  
cold desserts, small cheesecakes.  
mostly for gifts.  
each attempt reminded me of what i felt for someone.

watched a korean series: _"When life gives you tangerines"_  
damn, i cried a lot.  
i was in love at that moment.

short trips to bars and cafés.  
tried to focus my mind elsewhere.  
but the emptiness stayed.

had serious conversations.  
we tried to understand boundaries and emotions.  
i felt frustrated.  
every message could spark anxiety or joy.

slowly started disconnecting.

things got worse when social media interactions felt strange.  
i didn’t understand.  
that sent me into deeper desperation.

i think i stayed that way for 2 weeks, almost 3.

it was the first time i gave crochet flowers to someone.  
i really liked it.

> **_aquello que se entregó con amor perdura con el tiempo_**

that reminded me to not overthink.

---

## may

short version:

- despair
- calming down
- first flowers
- sister's graduation
- birds and insects tour

went to barcelona again.  
this time, saw almost all of the simplr team.  
it was somewhat boring, but i took photos.

my sister was finishing her studies.  
i was excited, took lots of pictures.  
wholesome moments, but i had to hide and disappear afterward.

one day i wanted to go to a birds and insects class near malaga.  
was going to go alone, but my mom joined.  
the car broke down that day, couldn’t go.  
devastating.

instead, went with mom to a cheese festival in the center.  
i was happy for a couple of days.  
but then another serious talk happened.

on may 27, i made a mistake.  
i confessed feelings that weren't reciprocated in the way i wanted.
the worst decision i could make.

the response was:

> _"calm down"_

like cold water dumped on my head.  
i started feeling bad.

we kept talking about that moment.  
i realized i couldn’t see this person just as a friend.  
it made me see i couldn’t keep waiting for romantic reciprocity.

i only felt: _sad, tired, nervous, anxious._

that night, we went to sleep.  
it was the last deep talk we had.

after that, i started writing and drawing to focus my mind.  
needed to express my feelings.

started taking flower pictures.  
wanted to go to the beach.  
wanted to start a mini terrarium.

---

## jun

short version:

- quiet month
- concerts and trekking
- third blood donation
- crochet flowers
- beginning of emotional independence

june started with a void.  
felt a gap in my conversations, in my daily thoughts.

tried to keep busy.  
gym was my main anchor.

went out more.  
natos and waor concert in madrid.  
close friends, laughs, singing songs.  
lost my voice again, but it was liberating.

third blood donation.  
small acts that gave me a sense of value.

started trekking with _perrito_.  
first short routes, then longer ones.  
watched insects, waterfalls, birds.  
it helped me connect with nature and with myself.

sometimes felt lonely, sometimes grateful for little joys.  
focus shifted to hobbies, creating, family.  
learning to occupy my mind.

and sometimes, late at night, the thoughts came back.  
felt bittersweet.  
but slowly, taking small steps.

still holding onto the quote:

> **_aquello que se entregó con amor perdura con el tiempo_**

it guided me to keep giving, keep creating, keep loving in my own way.

---

## july

short version:

- old towns
- sister and simba's birthdays
- dinner
- trust
- hospitals
- books

welp, i still needed to connect with nature and avoid just staying in my room.

so i started going out with my mom or alone to old towns.

i think we went to the smurf town (júzcar).  
there, i took a picture with a heart, but i was looking at the floor.  
a perfect picture of my situation.

by this moment, i had already removed a "maleante" from my life.  
i really felt bad those days, and i started to feel angry. a lot.

a friend went to a dinner, and that “person” went with us.  
i really wanted to kill him.  
but i tried not to think about it.

i started eating more ice cream,  
taking pictures of birds and plants.

my sister’s birthday was a peaceful day.  
she was happy and celebrating with her friends.

bad moments seemed to bring more bad moments.

well, the hospital cycles began.  
mom started not feeling well,  
and i needed to go several times, sometimes more than once a day.  
there were so many days i couldn’t sleep.  
more than my usual sleep deprivation of 3-4h.  
i started sleeping even less than that.

i started reading a lot.  
i wanted to read Dostoevsky, Kafka, philosophy…  
but i never bought a book.  
i went to the book festival and bought _White Nights_ by Dostoevsky.  
this book hit me.  
i loved it the same way i loved _Lolita_.  
it changed my mindset, and i knew i needed to read the rest of his books.

i started going out to cafes just to read.

this month, mom wanted to renovate the kitchen,  
so i really wanted her to feel well.  
i accepted that.
even though i wanted to buy a car,  
mom came first.  
we started looking at budgets.

trekking in Gaucín: four treks.  
the first one was just to see the route.  
we reached the lake,  
it was really cold,  
and we didn’t know Gaucín was far away with so many turns taking so long.

we had a time limit because perrito’s partner needed to return to Marbs.  
she had to work and arrive before 5pm, so by 3pm we had to start going back.  
welp, it wasn’t a problem.
perrito and i were more excited to see more than just the lake and explore the circular route.

---

## aug

short version:

- hospitals became familiar.
- trekking kept me moving. a helicopter.
- a family member was murdered.
- mental breakdown. i didn’t see it coming.

hospitals became almost familiar.
i spent so many hours there i stopped counting.
mom worried every time.
sometimes 5-9 hours just to complete a single process.
it was exhausting.
sleep was almost impossible.
trekking became my escape.
mountains, lakes, plain routes.
perrito and me walking endlessly.

then gaucín (six treks).
trekking again, trying to finish the circuit this time.
hot, heavy, endless.
i was tired, but pushing forward.
the helicopter incident.

that same day, devastating news.
my uncle was murdered.

i really try to focus, but i couldn't sleep well.
i was returning from the mountain.
i receive the shocked news.
i stay checking the phone for my mom.

also, this month was my crisis and mental breakdown hahaha.
oh fuck.
i was really fucked up that day.
and all i wanted to do was cry.

then a friend tells me a painful rumor about the "friend" i removed.  
the worst moment of all.
the worst mental breakdown of my life so far.
crying like never before.

blocked that person immediately.

days continued.
trekking. crafting.
trying to survive.
trying to breathe.
holding tiny glimpses of peace, fleeting and fragile.

august left me hollow.
exhausted.
but still moving.

---

## sept

short version:

- my birthday
- simplr’s party
- barcelona
- galicia
- madrid salvaje
- comic-con

the aftermath of august was still hanging over me.
hospitals, tears, broken sleep.
my mind replaying everything over and over.
trekking was still my refuge.
mountains, lakes, old towns.
alone or with perrito.
walking to survive, walking to forget.

i went to the beach alone, just to clear my mind and not think.
i left the whatsapp group.
i needed distance from everything.
no contact, no questions.

family moments.
birthdays, small celebrations.
i participate, smile, take pictures.

i create.
manual stuff.
cards, small gifts.
i keep going anyway.

then something different happened: an old coworker sent me a job proposal.
i needed a change.
i still had the idea to leave marbs to forget these feelings.
i tried at the end of 2024 but couldn’t for certain reasons.
now, with this proposal, i felt like i could finally leave.

galicia was the perfect escape.
for me, it was the best trip of the year.
i can’t describe how it felt to land in santiago de compostela.
i needed to connect with nature, and galicia gave me that.
mountains, streets, animals, plants.
i explored, i lost myself taking pictures.
i ate too much, drank white wine, tried _pulpo a la feira_, scallops, seafood.
i even saw the end of the camino de santiago and dreamed of trying it with perrito someday.
i hope in 2026 we can.

i loved the history in the cathedral.
this trip was a present from my parents, and i truly appreciated it.

back home, i celebrated my birthday a day early.
wonderful.
i received a lot of kuromi presents.
but on my birthday itself, i thought about the past year.

then i had to take a bus to barcelona for the new job and the simplr party.
the office visit was about conditions, the place, old coworkers—it felt nice to reconnect.
the simplr party was calm but happy; games, conversations, meeting people.

i spent a few extra days in barcelona.
walking, i found sunflowers, took a picture.
small gestures, little memories.

finally, i visited the new job office again, met cat briefly, took three taxis to fit everything in a single day.
returned to marbs and went to comic-con malaga.
not gonna lie… it was the worst festival for nerds.
mangafest without organization, everything expensive.
i spent 100-200 euros, saw almost nothing, mostly ate.

then it was time for madrid salvaje, a rap festival.
i enjoyed it, met someone new from girona unexpectedly.
then back to barcelona to keep moving, keep living, keep trying to survive this year.

september was a mix of small joys, travels, and moments of calm.
walking, traveling, celebrating… just trying to keep going.

## oct

short version:

- rocanrola (cancelled)
- cruz
- vultures
- axolotl (enemy)

when i return to marbs, i really know  
that i’m going to move to barcelona.

so i ask my close friends to arrange a meet-up with the other friends,  
because i want to share the good news.

welp, i told the good news to the people there,  
and that’s it.

i’m gonna say that this month was the “anniversary”  
when i went to the _cruz de juanar_ in 2024.

at first, i was gonna go alone,  
but perrito told me he also wanted to go.  
so we went together the day before the anniversary  
instead of the same day (i had already taken a vacation day).

we replicated the photos from that day.  
i prayed at the cruz,  
begging for peace for my beloved ones and my friends.

later, i went to alicante with a friend i met the previous year.  
so i went with him and his friends to the rocanrola festival.

although we were hyped, some alerts came up,  
warning about rain and thunderstorms,  
but the festival hadn't canceled anything yet.

welp, we reached the place,  
and a couple of hours before the festival was supposed to start,  
a red alert popped up on our phones,  
and the festival was forced to cancel the shows.

so, we drove a long time just for a canceled festival.

i was supposed to stay at the camping site,  
but now it was impossible.  
the friend i went with offered me a place to stay while we were in Alicante.

the idea was to return with them,  
but i decided to head back the day before instead of staying there.

we decided to go to gaucín again, the place where the helicopter incident happened.

gaucín was different this time.  
i loved that moment.  
i still have the pictures from that day,  
and i still look back at them.

although before achieving that perfect day, we went through a lot of issues:  
my car was moved by a tow truck,  
and when we reached the trail, there was Japanese weed everywhere,  
so we were warned not to do the trek.

when we reached the top, perrito had forgotten the bread.

so it was a day full of experiences.  
despite all the trouble we went through to get there.

welp, this month a new enemy appeared:  
the axolotl.

at first, he was just a friendly plushie,  
but later i discovered he was a really complicated adversary.

i went to Decathlon with perrito.

welp, again, i needed to return to Barcelona.

in bcn i was looking for a room to live in.  
in the end, i chatted with an old coworker,  
and he offered me a room because the person there was leaving.

perrito bought me a jacket for the mountain hehehe,  
it was really warm, i was really happy in those moments.

the rest of the days, i saw a "mochuelo" at night.  
i went to eat sushi with my family  
and my mom was jealous.

---

## nov

short version:

- parauta.
- “mirador de los gitanos” - best pictures.
- ironwoman and birdie.

welp, this month started with a family trip to parauta.  
we went to see the mythological path.

the old town was curious.  
the walk took 2-3h,  
but even longer if you stop to take pictures.

it was truly a wonderful day.  
mom was happy,  
and i took a lot of pictures of her.

the next day we went to the mountain with perrito.  
this time we went in another direction,  
the walking was easier.

we all were tired.  
i hadn't slept well after parauta.

but we reached the top, perrito guiding us.  
we took pictures of the environment.

the _island_ show started.  
not my type of content.  
i gave it a try,  
watched exactly 3 chapters.  
interesting,  
but stupid people doing stupid things.

one day i went to see the ironman 70.3.  
it was a fantastic day.

at my best friend’s birthday,  
i appreciated that we had stayed in touch,  
after all these years,  
after all the problems i gave him.

then came hell week.  
we went to sleep every day having an argument or conflict.  
every single day.  
sometimes i didn’t understand what the issue was.

welp, one day i went out with other friends for drinks.  
happy.  
discovered things.  
still happy.

i went to see an old friend,  
like a brother to me,  
just to disconnect.  
i felt more free,  
but there was still this heavy burden on my mind.

the next day: returning to barcelona.  
a padel match happened.

i secured the flat from my old coworker,  
and finally moved in during december.

listened to old music,  
sang out loud to think about something else.

the day before someone's birthday,  
went with perrito to the mountain,  
objective: see the sunrise.  
first attempt, no luck.  
returned to “mirador de las golondrinas 2.”

focused on work, music,  
the new Hard GZ album coming soon.

last day of the month.
went with perrito to the mountain at night,  
second attempt to see the sunrise.  
almost made it,  
but got running late.  
still, cool pictures.

## dec

short version:

- sister
- moving to barcelona
- evalion
- monserrat
- simplr’s party
- christmas
- trekking with perrito
- new year

okay, december was a month of many things.

welp, i bought flowers for my sister because she was the last one to receive them.  
i bought the biggest bouquet that i could.

the previous day i met up with sora and her gf.  
we spent some time talking, and i bought my first skincare products hehe.

and the next day i was moving to barcelona...

welp, the time in barcelona was bright because everything was new.  
i needed to shift my mindset to adapt to everything and to the job.  
i was really focused on work, putting in a lot of hours.

i didn’t have much free time.  
the first days i went to the center to buy presents for my friends,  
because by mid-december i would be returning to marbs.

this month i still created some photo dumps.

later we had the evalion christmas dinner.  
it was a wonderful time.  
we talked a lot, it felt like family, and played some games.  
i really enjoyed that.

somewhere during this month i found a cool website format.  
so i replicated it following my aesthetic, and added a blog page.  
and for that, i started writing hehe, in english, or at least trying.

finally, monserrat.  
i seriously needed mountains because my mind was ready to explode.  
monserrat is a place that i love and deeply appreciate.

the past year i couldn’t hike every route, and this time some shortcuts were shut down because of the heavy rain.  
welp, i started from the old town, expecting a one-and-a-half-hour walk (liars).  
it took me almost 4–5h.

although i rested at some points because i didn’t have the stamina, i needed to recover my strength.  
welp, it was precious, everything about it.  
i took a lot of pictures.  
this time i rode the cable car instead of the train.  
maybe next time i’ll actually do the walking route, hehe.

welp, the next day was for working.  
the new desk arrived in my room.  
i continued working on the website.

welp, we were closing in on the return to marbs.  
but before leaving, we met up with some folks from evalion for drinks.  
later i left them and headed to simplr’s party to see other friends.

and the fateful day arrived.  
i had to take a flight to AGP.  
almost missed it; i fell asleep because i had gone out yesterday and slept way too late.  
my Uber didn’t accept the ride, so i had to wait for another.  
it was complicated.

in the end, i caught the flight and reached marbs early.  
welp, i started preparing the gifts for christmas.  
i didn’t tell my friends that i had returned, only my bestfriend and perrito knew.

perrito and i wanted to head to the mountain, but it was raining a lot.  
i didn’t do anything, just kept working and stayed at home.

welp, the christmas party was cool.  
i received a new pair of shoes.  
so perrito and i decided to go to the mountain the very same day hehe, our third attempt.  
this time we had to turn back because we started hearing thunder nearby, so we retreated carefully.

the following day we went to the mountain again with perrito, this time aiming to catch the sunset.  
we achieved it hehehe.  
it was amazing.  
it is hard to explain, and the pictures i took will never capture what i truly saw in that moment.

later i asked my best friend and perrito to come to my place to eat a peruvian dish hehe.  
it was a calm, peaceful day.  
i was really exhausted from the mountain trips hahaha, and i had to pay to fix my car, so i was almost bordering on bankruptcy.

welp, i walked to the beach a few times just to look at the view.

and finally, almost on the last day, perrito and i made an attempt to see the sunrise.  
this time we set out too early.  
this had to be definitive because it was supposed to rain the next day (spoiler: it didn't).  
we reached the top.  
i was so fucking cold up there.  
uf.  
we had to wait almost 2 hours for the sunrise.

but it was fantastic: the sunrise, the sounds of the birds, the plants, the green hues…  
almost similar to the Galicia trip.

when we descended, the river had more flow, so it was quite difficult to cross hahaha.

in the afternoon, i should have gone to meet the other friends, but i was way too tired.  
SO TIRED.

that day i woke up 3–4 times.  
i didn’t want to celebrate the end of the year because i was simply tired.

welp, i got dressed and spent time with my family.

---

welp, as you can see, it was a dramatic journey, 2025, but i really embraced it.

i met perrito.
and who knows, maybe this new year we'll hike other mountains outside of marbs, cough cough BCN.

i love you all, especially my family and my _friends_.  
you all still have a space safely kept in my mind.
