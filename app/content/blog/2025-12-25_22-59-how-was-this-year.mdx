## jan

short version:  
- 3 trips  
- 2 conflicts with squirrel (solved yay!)  
- hard gz x anniversary concerts 
- minor guilt over old conflicts  

this month my main objective was replicate last year.  
in 2024 i went to hard gz in malaga.  
this time i needed madrid and bcn for x anniversary.  
i was really excited.  

i also brought some issues from previous year.  
breakdowns.  
squirrel was damaged.  
i wanted to solve what i provoked.  

i needed to fly for work 2-3 days.  
wanted to see simplr's and cat.  
i met her while looking for someone to go rocanrola.  
she was friendly and liked the same type of music.  
but in the end, i didn’t see anyone.  

near the end of the month, the conflict with squirrel was solved.  
before the bcn trip.  
i felt a little relief.  
guilt lingered for a couple of weeks.  

regarding the x anniversary in madrid:  
it was awesome.  
i really enjoyed the concert.  
alone.  
i sang all songs, shouted.  
lost my voice that day, haha.  

the second concert in bcn was almost similar,  
i went with cat.  
some songs missing, some collabs gone.  
still enjoyable.  
we sang a lot.  
memories i really treasure.

## feb

short version:  
- donate blood  
- itv (car inspection)  
- san valentin (painful)  
- cat trip  
- first psycho session  

this month still gives me nightmares.  

i went to donate blood.  
needed to do something meaningful.  
went alone.  
missed someone, but she was busy.  
didn’t ask.  

cat shared her trip photos.  
warm, unexpected.  
nice moment.  

itv.  
we were late.  
car didn’t pass.  
needed mechanic.  
almost caused conflict via whatsapp.  
my replies were dry.  
funny in retrospect.  

psycho session went well.  
told me i was improving compared to 2023.  
i talked about squirrel, conflicts, gifts, feelings.  
she encouraged me to act and feel.  

san valentin.  
first time doing such a thing.  
awkward.  
waited for her to give present.  
she was busy.  
i gave the gift.  
she said ***“no, no, no”*** at first (kill me).  
felt dumped.  
gift was received, not worse.  
main event of the month.

## mar

short version:  
- jsconf  
- salary increase  
- rural trip  
- squirrel talks  
- kuromi girl incident  
- alimoche bird  

everything seemed fine.  

first jsconf with midudev.  
loved the talks, met wonderful people.  

work meeting:  
salary increase approved.    
month started well.  

rural trip with friends.  
wanted to relax, chill with music, sleep.  
not big on socializing.  

house near river.  
first day dry, next days heavy rain.  
river full, hard to exit walking, even cars.  
enjoyable experience.  

later: meets with squirrel.  
serious talks.  
she shared her favorite bird, *alimoche*.  
still have the picture and emoji.  

**kuromi girl incident:**  
i disconnected from everything for two weeks.  
mom birthday, squirrel trip, dad birthday.  
retaking contact, i expressed too intensely.  
she told me to calm down.  
first time i had to hide my feelings.  
after san valentin, emotions were harder.  

---

## apr

short version:  
- second blood donation  
- attempts to disconnect  
- baking and gifts  
- tangerine series  
- low mood from distance  

april started with an attempt to calm down.  
i went to donate blood for the second time.  
i wanted to do something meaningful, something that actually helped.  

started baking.  
cold desserts, small cheesecakes.  
mostly for gifts, especially for squirrel.  
each attempt reminded me of what i felt for her.  

she recommended a korean series: *"When life gives you tangerines"*  
damn, i cried a lot.  
saw pictures of her crying.  
in love at that moment.  

ah, i remember we went to sushi this month.  
she was always beautiful, precious, marvelous.  
that smile, that excitement…  
so sad i had to try to erase those memories.  
i hope i remember her face, but i only have the sensation.  

short trips to bars and cafés.  
tried to focus my mind elsewhere.  
but the emptiness from not seeing her stayed.  

had serious conversations with squirrel.  
we tried to understand boundaries and emotions.  
i felt frustrated.  
every message could spark anxiety or joy.  

slowly started disconnecting.  

main issue:  
i used to talk to her every day.  
the first thing i remember when i woke up was saying gm,  
the same when going to sleep.  
i loved those moments, but that was the main problem.  

things got worse when she hid her IG stories.  
i didn’t understand.  
that sent me into deeper desperation.  

i think i stayed that way for 2 weeks, almost 3.  

she was the first person i gave crochet flowers to.  
i really liked it.  

> ***aquello que se entrego con amor perdura con el tiempo***  

that reminded me to not overthink,

## may

short version:  
- squirrel’s decisions  
- ig background  
- despair  
- calm down  
- first flowers  
- sister graduation  
- birds and insects tour  

we still kept talking, but i think this was the last time.  

i gifted her a little squirrel figure (no crochet).  
i loved how it turned out, so i made another in grey.  
posted it on ig.  

i still remember that moment.  
she changed the chat background.  
first to **"foliage"** style, then to *black*.  
i didn’t understand.  
i replied with a crying emoji, no answer.  

later i put the purple heart.  
the purple heart was our iconic connection.  
i still keep it as a keychain at home.  

i really wanted to buy her flowers.  
but past trauma from valentines held me back.  

went to barcelona again.  
this time, saw almost all of simplr’s team.  
it was boring, but i took photos.  

my sister was finishing her studies.  
i was excited, took lots of pictures.  
shared some with squirrel.  
wholesome moments, but i had to hide and disappear afterward.  

one day i asked if she wanted to go to a birds and insects class near malaga.  
she couldn’t go, so i was going alone, but my mom joined.  
car broke down that day, couldn’t go.  
devastating.  
i really wanted to take pictures to share with her.  

instead, went with mom to a cheese festival in the center.  
i was happy for a couple of days.  
but then another serious talk happened.  

on may 27, we talked normally.  
i said i liked her, then i said *i loved her*.  
the worst decision i could make.  

she replied: 
> *"calm down"*  

like cold water in my head.  
i started feeling bad.  
she did too.  


we kept talking about that moment.  
i realized i couldn’t see her as a friend.  
i didn’t want to lose her, but i couldn’t see her in any way that wasn’t romantic.  
made me see i couldn’t keep waiting for romantic reciprocity.  

she worried if i was mad.  
how could i be mad?  
i loved her.  

i only felt: *sad, tired, nervous, anxious.*  

some moments i just wanted to know if someone captured her interest.  
i knew i needed something to remove her from my mind.  

that night, we went to sleep.  
it was the last time we talked.  
her last words to me were:  

> *"good night, don’t cry a lot"*  

after that, i started writing and drawing to focus my mind.  
needed to express my feelings.  

started taking flower pictures.  
wanted to go to the beach.  
wanted to start a mini terrarium.

## jun

short version:  
- quiet month    
- concerts and trekking  
- third blood donation  
- crochet flowers  
- beginning emotional independence  

june started with a void.  
i couldn’t rely on squirrel like before.  
felt the gap in conversations, in daily thoughts.  

tried to keep busy.  
gym was my main anchor.  

went out more.  
natos and waor concerts in madrid.  
close friends, laughs, singing songs.  
lost my voice again, but it was liberating.  

third blood donation.  
small acts that gave me a sense of value.  

started trekking with *perrito*.  
first short routes, then longer ones.  
watched insects, waterfalls, birds.  
reminded me of moments with squirrel, painful and beautiful.  
but also helped me connect with nature and myself.  

sometimes felt lonely, sometimes grateful for little joys.  
focus shifted to hobbies, creating, family.  
learning to occupy my mind without depending on her presence.  

and sometimes, late at night, thoughts came back.  
the series, the sushi, the flowers…  
felt bittersweet.  
but slowly, small steps.  

still holding onto the quote:  

> ***aquello que se entrego con amor perdura con el tiempo***  

it guided me to keep giving, keep creating, keep loving in my way.  

---

## july

short version:  
- old towns  
- sister and simba birthdays  
- dinner  
- trust  
- hospitals  
- books  

welp, i still needed to connect with nature and avoid staying only in my home or room.  

so i started going out with my mom or alone to an old town.  

i think we went to the smurf town (juzcar).  
there, i took a picture with a heart, but i was looking at the floor  
a perfect picture of my situation.  

by this moment, i had already removed a "maleante" from my life.  
he started talking with the squirrel and i didn’t feel well knowing that.  
and every time i saw him, i noticed how he tried to hide me when he wrote to her.  

i really felt bad those days, and i started to feel angry. a lot.  

a friend went to a dinner, and that “person” went with us.  
i really wanted to kill him.  
but i tried not to think about it.  

i started taking more ice creams,  
taking pictures of birds and plants.  

my sister’s birthday was a peaceful day.  
she was happy and celebrating with her friends. 

one day, it was a moment when we coincided,  
but still, we didn’t really greet each other.  
she sat far away from me,  
came from the beach, and i couldn’t stop thinking:  
she went alone, or with someone?  
was it with that person?  

i started to break inside, but tried to stay calm (ha!).  
later, i couldn’t see her face,  
and talked to her even less.  

we ended the dinner,  
i needed to go out,  
i missed the opportunity to talk with her,  
yes, but i didn’t have the will to do it.  
and i only thought about her.  

bad moments seemed to bring more bad moments.  

well, hospital cycles began.  
mom started not feeling well,  
and i needed to go several times, sometimes more than once in a day.  
there were so many days i couldn’t sleep   
more than my usual sleep deprivation of 3-4h.  
i started sleeping even less than that.  

i started reading a lot.  
i wanted to read Dostoevsky, Kafka, philosophy…  
but i never bought a book.  
i went to the book festival and bought *White Nights* by Dostoevsky.  
this book hit me.  
i loved it the same way i loved *Lolita*.  
it changed my mindset, and i knew i needed to read the rest of his books.  

i started going out to cafes just to read.  

this month, mom wanted to renovate the kitchen,  
so i really wanted her to feel well.  
i accepted that.
even though i wanted to buy a car,  
mom came first.  
we started looking at budgets.  

trekking in Gaucín: four trekking.  
the first one was just to see the route.  
we reached the lake,  
it was really cold,  
and we didn’t know Gaucín was far away with so many turns.  

we had a time limit because perrito’s couple needed to return to Marbs.  
she had to work and arrive before 5pm, so by 3pm we had to start going back.  
welp, it wasn’t a problem
perrito and i were more excited to see more than just the lake and explore the circle route.

---

## aug

short version:

- hospitals became familiar.
- trekking kept me moving. a helicopter.
- birthdays.
- a family member was murdered.
- mental breakdown. i didn’t see coming.


hospitals became almost familiar.
i spent so many hours there i stopped counting.
mom worried every time.
sometimes 5-9 hours just to complete a single process.
it was exhausting.
sleep almost impossible.
trekking became my escape.
mountains, lakes, plain routes.
perrito and me walking endlessly.

then gaucin (six trekking).
trekking again, trying to finish the circuit this time.
hot, heavy, endless.
i was tired, but pushing forward.
the helicopter incident.

same day, devastating news.
my uncle was murdered.
same day i went to a birthday.
seeing squirrel, but only in the distance.

i really try to focus, but i didn’t sleep well.
i was returning from the mountain.
i receive the shocked news.
i stay checking the phone for my mom.

i see squirrel sometimes, but i stay in the lack.
i remember she said a lot of things.
i don’t hug her, i really want to, but
i can’t.
although she doesn't like it (me?).

other birthday, second time i see the squirrel.
i really enjoyed these moments because, welp, almost *“died“*.
so i start to appreciate certain moments.

and the other thing was,
this time i can see the face of squirrel and talk to her.
later we start talking a little.

this moment seems that we start talking again like before.
but i still feel that this shouldn’t happen.

although she said i can write her, it’s the consequences of my decisions.
i start to write her, but only sometimes.

was a moment that i write her and she said better we don’t return to the previous way.

how i feel so sad, i make a collage of pictures that i have of her.
a video, and i share with her.
didn’t like it.

and other moments,
i was blocked, soft blocked, removed.
she said i should remove all the pictures,
so i remove all the photos, memories.
still hurt.

i didn’t remember everything.
but now i don’t have anything to remember 2024 or early 2025.
and that was all for this.

i still feel devastated, but this doesn’t stop me from continuing to buy things to gift her,
start doing a lot of manual stuff.
although in the end i didn’t give her.

also this month was my crisis and mental breakdown hahhaha.
oh fuck.
i was really fucked that day.
and i only want to cry.

then a friend tells me she was holding hands with someone else (*cough, cough, a "friend"*).
the worst moment of all.
the worst mental breakdown of my life so far.
crying like never before.

blocked that person immediately.

days continued.
trekking. crafting.
trying to survive.
trying to breathe.
holding tiny glimpses of peace, fleeting and fragile.

august left me hollow.
exhausted.
but still moving.

---

## sept

short version:

- my birthday
- simplr’s party
- barcelona
- galicia
- madrid salvaje
- comic-con

the aftermath of august still hanging over me.
hospitals, tears, broken sleep.
my mind replaying everything over and over.
trekking still my refuge.
mountains, lakes, old towns.
alone or with perrito.
walking to survive, walking to forget.

i went to the beach alone, just to clear my mind and not think.
i left the whatsapp group.
i needed distance from everything.
she asked if it was because of her.
i said no… but that was a half-truth.
i needed to stop thinking about her.
no contact, no questions.
what could i ask her?
nothing.
i couldn’t.

squirrel.
i see her sometimes.
sometimes we talk a little.
small gestures, brief words.
but always under the weight of consequences.
i want more than she can give.
i know it, she knows it.
we both feel it.

family moments.
birthdays, small celebrations.
i participate, smile, take pictures.

i create.
manual stuff.
cards, small gifts.
all thinking about her.
some things never given.
some memories erased.
i keep going anyway.

then something different happened: an old coworker sent me a job proposal.
i needed a change.
i still had the idea to leave marbs to forget these feelings.
i tried at the end of 2024 but couldn’t for certain reasons.
now, with this proposal, i felt like i could finally leave.

galicia was the perfect escape.
for me, it was the best trip of the year.
i can’t describe how it felt to land in santiago de compostela.
i needed to connect with nature, and galicia gave me that.
mountains, streets, animals, plants.
i explored, i lost myself taking pictures.
i bought presents for her… and yep, i never learn hahaha.
i ate too much, drank white wine, tried *pulpo a la feira*, scallops, seafood.
i even saw the end of the santiago path and dreamed of trying it with perrito someday.
i hope in 2026 we can.

i loved the history in the cathedral.
this trip was a present from my parents, and i truly appreciated it.

back home, i celebrated my birthday a day early.
wonderful.
i received a lot of kuromi presents.
but on my birthday itself, i thought about the past year.
squirrel invited me for coffee.

but this time, i went alone, ordered the same drink she had the year before, took a picture, shared it with her.
she congratulated me… and that was it.
i didn’t know what to do, so i did nothing.

then i had to take a bus to barcelona for the new job and the simplr party.
the office visit was about conditions, the place, old coworkers—it felt nice to reconnect.
the simplr party was calm but happy; games, conversations, meeting people.

i spent a few extra days in barcelona.
walking, i found sunflowers, took a picture, shared it with squirrel.
small gestures, little memories.
that same day, my mind wandered… thinking of her.

finally, i visited the new job office again, met cat briefly, took three taxis to fit everything in a single day.
returned to marbs and went to comic-con malaga.
not gonna lie… the worst festival for nerds.
mangafest without organization, everything expensive.
i spent 100-200 euros, saw almost nothing, mostly ate.

then it was time for madrid salvaje, a rap festival.
i enjoyed it, met someone new from girona unexpectedly.
then back to barcelona to keep moving, keep living, keep trying to survive this year.

september was a mix of small joys, travels, and moments with her—sometimes brief, sometimes distant—but always weighted by the past, by feelings that i couldn’t untangle.
walking, traveling, celebrating… just trying to keep going.

## oct

short version:

- rocanrola (cancelled)
- cruz
- vultures
- axolotl (enemy)
- new note
- the chorizo’s heart
- the word “date“

when i return to marbs, i really know  
that i’m going to move to barcelona.  

so i ask my close friends to make an appointment to meet the other friends,  
because i want to say the good news.  

i expected that squirrel would come that day,  
but that didn’t happen.  
although i was warned days ago.  

welp, i told the good news to the people there,  
and that’s it.  

i’m gonna say that this month was the “anniversary”  
when i went to the *cruz de juanar* in 2024 with squirrel.  

welp, how could i invite her to go out with me more  
when she didn’t want to come to the meet  
where i wanted to say the “good news”?  

at first, i was gonna go alone,  
but perrito told me he also wanted to go.  
so we went together the day before the anniversary  
instead of the same day (already took a vacation day).  

but a few days before, she wrote me.  

welp, something weird happened at that moment.  
she asked me at 2 or 3 am to go out on another route  
instead of the cruz, only if we wanted (perrito/me).  

welp, i talked with perrito,  
and we decided to go out, just the two of us.  

we replicated the photos from that day.  
i prayed for the cruz,  
begging for calm for my beloved ones and my friends.  
also, if i could, to get in touch with her again.  

she seemed angry at first,  
removed me,  
but the next day, by coincidence,  
she saw me and asked where i was going,  

so, we took a coffee again.  
we didn’t trust much,  
but i really loved the moment when i saw her.  

we talked about a lot of things,  
and moments,  
also regarding the ghosting on both sides,  
more on my side,  
more my way to hide myself.  

at the end, we started talking again,  
but this time i said i feel the sensation  
that we always return to talk.  
yes, i’m delusional.  
i’m expecting something could change.  

later, i went to alicante with a friend i met the previous year.  
so i went with him and friends to the rocanrola festival.  

although we were hyped, some alerts came up,  
warning about rain and thunder,  
but the festival didn’t cancel anything yet.  

welp, we reached the place,  
and a couple of hours before the festival should start,  
a red alert jumped into our phones,  
and the festival was forced to cancel the shows.  

so, we moved and drove a lot of time for a canceled festival.  

i was going to stay in the camping,  
but now it was impossible.  
the friend i went with offered me a place to stay while we were in Alicante.  

the idea was to return with them,  
but i decided to return the day before instead of staying there.  

i continued talking with squirrel and perrito,  
so we decided to go to gaucín, the place where the helicopter incident happened.  

i was really excited,  
only because i could go with squirrel hahah.  

gaucín was different this time.  
i loved that moment.  
i still have the pictures from that day,  
and i still return to them.  
i see her smile.  
how she kept sitting looking for the vultures.  
she was really excited.  

i was really pleased when i gave her the prismatic,  
ah… that hat she had.  
the picture we took, the three of us.  

although before achieving that day, we went through a lot of issues:  
my car was moved by tow truck,  
and when we reached the place, it was Japanese waste,  
so we were warned not to do the trekking.  

when we reached the top, perrito forgot the bread.  

so it was a lot of experiences that day,  
but i was really happy just seeing her.  

although at first she was angry,  
october was fantastic.  
you were smiling  
despite all the trouble we went through to get there.  

i don’t know if you want me to keep these pictures,  
but for now i still appreciate them sometimes,  
when photos remind me of that day.  

welp, this month a new enemy appeared:  
the axolotl (he won at the end).  

at first, he was a friendly plushie,  
but later i discovered he was a really complicated adversary.  
he took the first place instead of the squirrel crochet.  
i need to revenge my squirrel.  

welp, jks apart,  
i really appreciated the way she showed me her daily life,  
although sometimes i misunderstood some phrases (more info in the book).  

it was really happy days, i think.  
welp, one day we had a conflict  
because i said something i shouldn’t.  
i’m really emotive,  
you don’t know how much i feel when i see another note  
on my laptop,  
only thanking me for something.  

i wake up and see that note.  
it was precious.  
i still save the little things she gave me:  
papers, notes, and the calendar.  

i went to Decathlon with perrito,  
but i also wanted to go with squirrel.  
but she was busy,  
seems she didn’t take it well that i was there without her.  

welp, again, i needed to return to Barcelona.  

this last time, i really approached to say my feelings.  
so when i wanted to say “i like you,”  
we talked about love.  

she shared with me the chorizo’s heart.  
i remember the aceitunas and some breakfast she offered me,  
but no one reached my door.  

one day, we were talking to go on another trekking.  
at first, i thought it was both of us,  
but it seems she wanted to go with more people.  
she didn’t want to go only with me (still hurts yet).  

i don’t know how we reached this point,  
i’m working in the new job,  
focusing,  
but she jumped with this topic.  
welp, i didn’t feel good to continue talking.  
so i said that i would answer later.  

i don’t know how panic both in that moment,  
i never said this would be a date,  
but she thought it was, or something similar,  
and that was the main issue.  

at the end, we decided to go (for nothing because it was raining there).  

in bcn i was looking for a room to live.  
at the end, i chatted with an old coworker,  
and he offered me a room because the person there left at some point.  

perrito bought me a jacket for the mountain hehehe,  
it was really warm, i was really happy in those moments.  

the rest of the days, i saw a "mochuelo" at night.  
i went to sushi with my family  
because in the previous month i went with squirrel,  
and my mom was jealous.  

---

## nov

short version:

- parauta.
- “mirador de los gitanos” - best pictures.
- ironwoman and birdie.
- a bad week.
- **the fucking wrong decision.**
- no birthday. no gift. my consequences.

welp, this month started with a family's trip to parauta.  
we went to see the mythological path.  

the old town was curious.  
the walk took 2-3h,  
but even more if you stop to take pictures.  

here i took another photo with the love behind me,  
but again, a sad moment.  

it was really a wonderful day.  
mom was happy,  
and i took a lot of pictures of her.  

the next day we went to the mountain with squirrel, also perrito.  
a way to beg for mercy for the previous missed food.  
this time we went in another direction,  
the walking was easier,  
although squirrel was not feeling well at all.  

i remember she said *“GN!”* instead of **good night** the previous day.  
i tried to invite her,  
but she needed to do her things,  
i don’t know if she could.  
at the end she accepted to go out.  

both of us were tired.  
i didn’t sleep well after parauta,  
and squirrel was also tired.  

but we reached the top, perrito guided us.  
we took pictures of the environment.  
aaaaand squirrel asked for some pictures.  
fantastic,  
because a year ago it was blocked to take her photos (mmmph!).  
but i took really good shots.  
that fucking smile…  
hate me, but i still love you.  

she took some pictures with a roll camera that she later had to reveal.  
i know i’ll never receive those pictures.  
i don’t know if they are good to share.  
she told me she would give me one.  
i hope i can see at least one.  

the *island* show started.  
not my type of content,  
but a chance to talk with her about something different.  
i gave it a try,  
watched 3 chapters only.  
interesting,  
but stupid people doing stupid things,  
everyone horny (like me on twt).  

this month i finally received the present for my best friend and squirrel.  
nothing prepared for me in the following days and weeks (kill me).  
nothing was wonderful.  
that day i went again to the hospital,  
didn’t sleep anything.  

one day i went with squirrel to breakfast and to see the ironman 70.3.  
she was really excited,  
she loves that triathlon series and those people.  
it was wonderful to see her express herself like that.  
i still wonder if i really love her,  
but in that moment my heart warmed,  
and my tears started to appear.  
a little sad,  
but a fantastic day.  

we walked a lot,  
she didn’t want to tell me what was bothering her.  
i noticed something in her mind,  
not me,  
but i didn’t push.  
just wait until she wanted to tell me.  

at my best friend’s birthday,  
i appreciated that we stayed in touch,  
after all the years,  
after all the problems i gave him.  
he and his wife noticed i was talking to squirrel again.  
the *toxic relationship*
welp, i cannot deny that.  

then started the hell week.  
something felt weird during that birthday.  
she didn’t say anything,  
didn’t share anything like before.  
weird.  

i wrote twice or three times,  
no reply.  
finally answered at 3am.  
i woke up at 5am,  
saw her reply.  
still relieved,  
but something bothered me that day.  

i don’t ask questions when something feels wrong.  
i act like you:  
eyes for eyes, teeth for teeth.  
i don’t overshare,  
i was dull,  
didn’t want to talk more.  

she only said she was tired.  
i didn’t know why.  
all i could think: *why?*  
never understood fully.  

she started to not share anything about her day.  
we went to sleep every day with an argument or conflict.  
every single day.  
i knew why.  
it wasn’t about her going out until 3am.  
she was preoccupied, irritable faster than usual.  
sometimes i didn’t understand the issue.  

one day she said she felt controlled when online.  
surprise.  
i didn’t expect that.  
after *good nights*, she still checked me?  
why?  
was she afraid?  
doing something bad?  
does it matter?  
we're friends, right?

later, she told me that she had spoken to someone again.   
i think this was the main reason.  

on the important day,  
she finally told me what it was (good news).  
man, i cried for her.  
i was really happy for her.  
i cared a lot.  
i sent encouragement messages,  
voice messages.  
crying, i was so happy.  

we started again with happy mood,  
but not for long.  
she returned to not sharing,  
or sharing less.  
disappeared until 3-4am.  
i felt uneasy.  

i wrote a couple times thinking she fell asleep,  
but she went out without saying anything.  
sometimes i overshare,  
sometimes she doesn’t.  
i left a message,  
waited for her to write.  

welp, a day i went with other friends to drinks.  
happy.  
discovered things,  
still happy.  

then she wrote she was in the hospital.  
i was a little drunk (maybe).  
requested an uber, went to the hospital.  

**the worst fucking decision.**  
i arrived, entered, saw her mom understood she wasn’t alone.  
i needed to go out.  
she came behind me, saw me.  
angry, of course.  

the next day, as expected,  
i was dumped again, asked to leave her.  
“friends” for me? nope.  

so here we go again:  
ludox, jofiel, feeling sad.  
normal.  

i went to see an old friend,  
another brother,  
just to disconnect,  
talk about her without feeling judged.  
felt more free,  
but still this issue in my mind.  

the next day: return to barcelona.  
even more devastating.  
padel match that she was interested in.  
nothing happened.  

i took the flat from my old coworker,  
finally moved in december.  

i wanted to repeat sushi with her,  
always something happened.  
went alone.  
enjoyed a little.  

listened to old music,  
sang a lot to think about other things.  

the day before her birthday,  
went with perrito to the mountain,  
objective: see the sunrise.  
first attempt, no luck.  
returned to “mirador de las golondrinas 2.”  

on her birthday,  
i congratulated her,  
wanted to buy flowers,  
give my present.  
my present: ***a declaration of love.***  
not the moment,  
but my last attempt.  

sometime walked with mom,  
saw her.  
she wasn’t feeling well?  
maybe just my mind.  
saluted her with a nod.  
she raised her hand, doubting.  

same day, discovered she hid me on IG stories.  
didn’t understand why.  

focused on work, music,  
new Hard GZ album coming soon.  

still had the present on my desk.  
remembered the phrase:  

> “merecer una persona que te haga sentir como el primer traguito de café por la mañana, caliente, necesario e irremplazable.”  

last day of the month. 
went with perrito to the mountain at night,  
second attempt to see sunrise.  
almost reached,  
but got late.  
still, cool pictures.

## dec

short version:

- sister  
- moving to barcelona  
- evalion  
- monserrat  
- simplr’s party  
- christmas  
- trekking with perrito  
- new year  

okey, december had a lot of things.  

first, i still had the hope that she could write me just to say goodbye or bye.  
but what could i expect?  
if i remember other moments, we never said that when we disconnected.  

welp, i bought flowers for my sister because it was the last one to receive it.  
i bought the biggest bouquet that i could.  

the previous day i met with sora and her gf.  
we spent some time talking and bought the first skincare hehe.  

and the next day i was moving to barcelona… squirrel never appeared.  

welp, the time in barcelona was happy because everything was new.  
i needed to change my mind to adapt to the new things and the job.  
i was really focused on work, so i stayed a lot of hours working.  

i didn’t have much time.  
the first days i went to the center to buy presents for my friends,  
because at mid-december i would return to marbs.  

this month i still created some dumps photos.  

later we had the evalion christmas dinner.  
it was a wonderful time.  
we talked a lot, it felt like a family, and did some games.  
i really enjoyed that.  

in this month i found a curious site.  
so i replicated it following my interests and added a blog page.  
and for that, i started writing hehe, in english or trying.  

finally, monserrat.  
i really needed mountains because my mind was going to explode.  
monserrat is a place that i love and truly appreciate.  

the past year i couldn’t go to every route, and this time some shortcuts were shut down because of the previous rain.  
welp, i started from the old town, walking one and a half hours (liars).  
it took me almost 4–5h.  

although i rested in some points a lot because i didn’t have form, i needed to recover my strength.  
welp, it was precious, everything.  
i took a lot of pictures.  
this time i went through the teleferic instead of the train.  
maybe next time i’ll go for the walking route hehe.  

seems that in monserrat squirrels appeared, i needed to find them.  
i wanted pictures, because they reminded me of her.  

welp, the next day was working.  
the new desk arrived in my room.  
i continued with the website.  

welp, we were reaching the return to marbs.  
but before we went to some evalions to take drinks.  
later i left them and went to simplr’s party to see other friends.  

and the fateful day arrived.  
i had to take a flight to AGP.  
almost missed it; i fell asleep because i went out yesterday and slept too late.  
my Uber didn’t accept the drive, so i had to wait for another.  
it was complicated.  

at the end, i took the flight and reached marbs early.  
welp, i started to prepare the gifts for christmas.  
i didn’t tell my friends that i returned, only my bestfriend and perrito knew.  

perrito and i wanted to go to the mountain, but it was raining a lot.  
i didn’t do anything, only continued working and staying at home.  

welp, on christmas eve i started writing about the previous post because squirrel blocked me, unblocked me, and silenced me—well, the same way as other persons.  

welp, the christmas party was cool.  
i received a new pair of shoes.  
so perrito and i decided to go to the mountain the same day hehe, third attempt.  
this time we had to return because we started hearing thunders nearby, so we went carefully.  
this time squirrel enabled me again on stories.  
i don’t know why.  

the following day we went to the mountain again with perrito, this time trying to see the sunset.  
we achieved it hehehe.  
it was amazing.  
hard to explain, and the pictures i took never will reach what i saw in that moment.  

later i asked my bestfriend and perrito to come to my home to eat a peruvian dish hehe.  
it was a calm day.  
i was really tired from the mountain trips hahaha, and i had to fix the car, so i was almost near bankruptcy.  

welp, i went to the beach sometimes to see cool views.  

and finally, almost the last day, perrito and i tried to go see the amanecer.  
this time we went too early.  
this time it was definitive because the next day it would rain (spoiler: nope).  
we reached the top.  
i was so fucking cold there.  
uf.  
we had to wait almost 2h for the amanecer.  

but it was fantastic: the amanecer, the birds’ sounds, the plants, the green…  
almost similar to the Galicia trip.  

when we returned, the river had more flow, so it was quite difficult to move hahaha.  

in the afternoon, i should have gone to meet other friends, but i was really tired.  
SO TIRED.  

AND THE SQUIRREL WAS THERE.  
i missed the opportunity to see her.  
i only saw a picture of her hand from the wa group.  
but i saw it and fell asleep again.  

that day i woke up 3–4 times.  
i didn’t want to celebrate the end of year because i was tired.  

welp, i prepared and took time with my family.  
and the mysterious squirrel appeared with a like on my story.  
i understood that i could congratulate her for the new year (although later more issues?).  
but i was really happy to see that interaction.  
i hope this year is for her.  

---

welp, as you can see, it was a dramatic journey, 2025, but i really enjoyed it.  
i still like a squirrel; sometimes i see her in my memories.

i meet perrito.
and who knows, maybe this new year we go to other mountains outside of marbs, cough cough BCN.  

i love everyone, especially my family and *friends*, and you, *squirrel*.  
you still have a space in my mind.
