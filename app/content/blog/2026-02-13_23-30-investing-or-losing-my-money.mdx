well, well.  
this is already our second year investing...

i have to warn you… i've been in this game of "losing" or "winning" since 2013.  
that was more or less the time i discovered BTC and cryptos...  
i'm still with them...

i didn't get rich.  
but i get something out of them from time to time.  
at least they were good enough to finance my purchases in japan hahaha.

i don't talk much about it.  
we only started with the MyInvestor pension plan because of the tax deduction.  
it was interesting.

later i started with the Indie robo-advisor that replicates an MSCI World...

the returns are fine...  
i closed last year with a 10% profit.

although close to the end of 2025, i started looking at other investment funds.

since i'm already very exposed to the USA,
i decided to start betting on emerging markets.

Pictet China, Small caps, Japan Deep Value, and the Value C fund.

although these funds are just starting out with my capital.

they won't even take up 20% of my portfolio.

since these are automated funds, i don't keep a close eye on them.

then, as experiments, i started looking at Stocks.

some stocks i bought in MyInvestor were LYB, Befesa, and Viscofan...  
Nextil, a company i bought just to follow the trend from La Pizarra de Andres.

i'm starting to get interested in companies with dividends and interesting cash flows...

recently i discovered the Geraldine Weiss analysis...  
it focuses more on a company's dividend.  
what i like is being able to decide entry/exit points for a company.

or in my case, accumulation points for certain companies.  
to be able to build my dividend portfolio for the future.

since i started a bit with Stocks, and MyInvestor isn't that decent for it.  
i migrated to Scalable Capital...  
i think it will be temporary.  
i don't like that the shares are through collective purchase...  
i didn't understand it well at the time.  
but well, it's a problem i'll figure out later, where to transfer my shares in the future.

in Scalable Capital i've been playing around or researching more companies.  
electricity, uranium, gold...

well, my idea is to keep learning how this investing thing works.  
how Calls/Puts work.  
Options, which a coworker was telling me about today...

i started getting a bit more interested in investment podcasts or reading.  
i still have to get used to reading again.  
but well.  
for now, these are the first steps...  
we'll see how this evolves.
