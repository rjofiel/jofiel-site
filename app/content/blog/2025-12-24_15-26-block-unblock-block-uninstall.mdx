## christmas eve…

first of all…  
english is not my native language.  
so this will be broken english, half-fixed by an llm, or some random translator…  
i guess this is how you learn to write.  
but that's for another moment.

hi.  
yesterday, when i went to sleep, my mind started doing its thing again.  
thinking about this year.  
it always happens.  
since 2023, at least.  
someone probably knows why.

i started thinking about people.  
friends.  
connections i lost.  
some because they left.  
some because i decided to cut them off.  
sometimes unilaterally.

this is my _casita de cartón_, but public.  
so i'm going to talk about people i blocked.  
or people who blocked me.  
or both.

i'm going to write freely, following my mood.  
maybe i'll use elements to represent people.  
maybe i won't.

## kuromi girl

february.  
not exactly february, but let's say february.

ana decided to completely cut communication with me.  
it felt weird.  
months before, she was still pinging me.  
asking how i was.  
talking about her life.  
her problems.

i had just come back from japan.  
(amazing trip, but that's another post.)  
i knew she loved japanese culture — anime, fashion, all that.  
so when i had the chance to buy something for her, i did.

at that time, i thought of her as my best friend.  
or something like that.

in february, i tried to contact her.  
i really wanted to give her the presents.  
kuromi stuff.  
japanese stationery.  
an amulet.  
and a letter thanking her for 2023.

she replied.  
eventually.  
and since i had to go to madrid for jsconf (i think),  
i used that as an excuse to see her and give her the gifts.

it didn't go well.  
she wasn't feeling good those days.  
so i postponed it.  
but i called her and told her the present existed.  
i didn't know if i'd be back in madrid anytime soon.

we talked a lot that day.  
about the trip.  
about random stuff.

i sent the package.  
and when she received it…  
she disappeared.

she never told me if she liked it.  
or if it was cringe.  
or bullshit.  
nothing.

months before, i had lent her some money.  
october or november 2024.  
so i asked for it back.  
and i also asked if we had a problem.

she said i was giving off bad vibes.  
strange vibes.  
that she felt i was developing feelings for her.  
so she decided to cut everything.

it was… weird.  
i still don't fully understand it.

this was the first time i removed someone from everywhere:  
phone.  
whatsapp.  
steam.  
discord.

i forgot twitter.

twitter matters because…  
i saw one of her tweets.  
another breakdown.  
again.

i tried to help.  
it didn't make sense.

we exchanged two or three replies.  
then she brought up 2023.  
a “friend”.  
that moment unlocked a lot of memories.

that's when i decided to fully remove her from my life.  
trust was broken.  
loyalty too.

this month she texted me “by mistake”.  
i left her on read.  
i didn't have the energy for more bullshit.

## the friend with suicidal thoughts

this one will be short.

this friend is… intermittent.  
follows me.  
unfollows me.  
disappears.  
comes back.

some months ago he messaged me on instagram.  
asking for help with his pc.  
this year i was exhausted.  
always traveling.  
always escaping.

helping him was complicated.  
then he unfollowed me again.  
stopped replying on whatsapp.

i don't know if we have a problem.  
but the behavior is weird.  
and i'm tired of this kind of shit.

## los maleantes

this one is recent.  
and this time i decided to end it.

i felt betrayed.  
i still do.

something small for others.  
huge for me.

i was warned.  
by many people.  
but i still trusted him.

the first time i noticed something was wrong (he started talking with her)  
was the night he needed me.  
2am.  
i left my house to help him.  
i saw a notification on his phone.  
that moment stayed with me.

the next day we talked.  
i asked him directly about those chats.  
i remember the messages.  
i know him, and that's when everything started to rot.

what hurt the most wasn't just _what_ happened, but _how_ it happened.  
things were hidden.  
half-truths.  
silences.  
and knowing how i was feeling at that time makes it worse.

the group dynamic changed.  
slowly, but irreversibly.

the final blow came when another friend told me he had seen them together.  
holding hands.  
out of all people, that was the one i trusted not to lie to me.

that day, i broke.
again.

i don't want to know anything about him anymore.  
i don't care.  
for me, he's gone.

we blocked each other.  
removed each other everywhere.

i was feeling replaceable.  
background noise.  
something disposable.

## an lingering memory

this one is harder.

i don't even know if i should include it.  
because histories like this never really end cleanly.

you can see a pattern sometimes.  
blocked.  
unblocked.  
ghosted.  
ghosting.

this one hurt more, simply because feelings were unilateral.  
it's not a secret.  
so you can imagine how it ends.

we're both impulsive.  
me more than her.

i stopped talking to her once.  
then again.  
because i wanted more.  
and she didn't.

i spent the summer thinking about it.  
trying not to.  
trekking.  
driving to old towns.

we talked again.  
briefly.  
i messed up.  
again.

the last time we talked, she said she was tired.  
that was enough for me.

i said “take care”.  
and disappeared.

i still see her sometimes.  
we say hi.  
nothing more.

for my brain, it's just a faded connection now.  
well, that's the only way i know how to forget.

and that's it.

this year i “lost” almost four people.

what a run.
