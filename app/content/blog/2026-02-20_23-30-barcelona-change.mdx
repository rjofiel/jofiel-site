so, i've been in barcelona for a few months now.  
yes... although it might not seem like it,  
since i started working here, i haven't really detached myself from this place.

i've had good moments and bad moments.  
it reminds me a bit of 2023.  
but in the end, everything is turning out alright for now.

i've spent several days grinding at the new job.  
learning about react, python, and getting deep into evals.  
it's been interesting.

really happy about the change overall.  
let's hope things keep going well.

also... i finally went back to the gym.  
now the goal is to consistently go 3-4 days a week.

i even started a "routine" for skincare.  
taking my vitamins, collagen, and magnesium.

and now... finally...  
after a long time of not doing it, i'm going to start taking protein again.  
we'll see how much we can improve this month...

the main goal though?  
losing about 15kg.  
we'll see if it's possible...

and well, that's it.  
just wanted to update this.
